# WeatherForecast
It is small project to display weather forecast using weather API, This was made in Dec 2018. I used API using an inbuilt open-source python wrapper i.e weather-api 1.0.6.
https://pypi.org/project/weather-api/ 
It is deprecated as of now ,however we can see code and use other APIs to display weather
